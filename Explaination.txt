 One pager explaining how distributed computing reduced computation time
 
 1. So with distributed computing a broke down the satelite propagation task into single satelite poisiton deparsing into each individual subtask
 2. As the subtasks were independent, so MultiProcessing came into place
 3. With Multiprocessing, i tried utilising the available cores of the system.
 4. So with more number of cores , the task gets more effiecient.
 5. As i have machine limitation, i achieved a low reduced time, but with more cores, this gets better.
 6. Further my approach would be to use GPUs cores to further optimise it.
 7. And Hence By leveraging distributed computing technique, i tried optimising the code.
